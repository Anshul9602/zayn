                  <p>It has always been a difficult matter to determine what constitutes precious stone. The term
                    precious stone refers to four specific stones Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds & Sapphires. All precious
                    stones are translucent and are valued by the richness of the color except for the diamond, which has
                    a higher value based on being colorless. This rarity beauty and method in which they are produced
                    all add to the allure of a precious stone.

                    <li style="font-weight: 400; list-style:circle"><strong>Diamond</strong><strong> - </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Diamond is the most popular of all gemstones. Diamond is a mineral compound made of pure carbon which takes millions of years to form. Diamonds are mineral compound made
                        of pure carbon. The Diamond can only be cut or polished by another diamond as they are the hardest
                        substance on earth. The word diamond is derived from Greek word &lsquo;adamus&rsquo; which means
                        invincible. Diamonds are available in various colors such as yellow brown, grey, pink, black red
                        etc. Highest priced diamonds are the ones that are colorless. Diamonds are measured in carats.
                        The higher the carat weight &amp; purity level of a stone, the more valuable the gem.</span>

                    <li style="font-weight: 400; list-style:circle"><strong>Emerald</strong><strong> - </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerald is one of the most valued gemstone. It is bluish green to
                        green in color. Gem experts differ on the degree of green that makes one stone an emerald and
                        another stone a less- expensive beryl. Emerald was once cherished by the Pharaohs, Moguls,
                        Aztecs and Inca kings. Today this fine gem is found in Africa, South America &amp; Central
                        Asia.</span></li>

                      <strong>R</strong><strong>ub</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> - </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ruby is a pink to deep red precious gemstone. The name comes from
                        Latin word for red, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruber</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Rubies are said to attract good luck for the wearer. Ancient Hindus
                        believed that rubies provided protection from evil. Today it symbolizes love and passion. It is
                        called &lsquo;Ratnaraj&rsquo; or &ldquo;King of Precious Stones&rdquo; in Sanskrit. Rubies can
                        command the highest per-carat price of any colored stone. This makes ruby one of the most
                        important gemstone in the colored stone market. Chromium is the trace element that causes

                  <p>Stones that were found in abundance were labeled semi-precious. Despite the classification, it is
                    not necessary that a precious stone is always more valuable. For Ex. Tsavorite is classified as a
                    semi-precious stone but it is more valuable than an emerald which is classified as a precious stone.
                    Use of the term ‘Precious’ and ‘Semi Precious’ in a commercial context is misleading as it implies
                    that certain stones are more valuable than other, which is not the case.
                    <br /><br />
                    There is no universally accepted grading system for gemstones. Diamonds are graded using a system
                    developed by GIA using 10x magnification. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye.
                    While choosing a gemstone it is most important to choose the right color, which is its most defining
                    characteristic. <br />
                    <br />
                    The right Hue, Tone and Saturation increase the value of the stone.

                          Some shades are more sought after than others and some with a tinge of brown or Grey are
